# Incorrect Div Selector in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an incorrect selector is used in JavaScript to target a specific HTML element. The bug causes the intended text replacement not to occur.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in how the JavaScript script attempts to select the div element. The selector `"#myDiv.myClass"` is incorrect. To properly select the element only by its ID, it should be `"#myDiv"`.
